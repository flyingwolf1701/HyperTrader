# Sliding Window Implementation - Summary

## Implementation Completed

Successfully implemented proper list-based sliding window tracking for the HyperTrader bot.

## Key Changes Made

### 1. **UnitTracker** (`strategy/unit_tracker.py`)
- Added `trailing_stop: List[int]` - tracks units with active stop-loss orders
- Added `trailing_buy: List[int]` - tracks units with active limit buy orders
- Added helper methods:
  - `add_trailing_stop()` / `remove_trailing_stop()`
  - `add_trailing_buy()` / `remove_trailing_buy()`
- Kept old `SlidingWindow` class for backward compatibility (marked deprecated)

### 2. **Main Trading Logic** (`main.py`)
- Completely rewrote `_slide_window()` to use list-based approach
- Added `_slide_window_up()`:
  - Adds stop at current-1
  - Removes and cancels stop at current-5 (if > 4 stops)
- Added `_slide_window_down()`:
  - Removes triggered stop from list
  - Adds buy at current+1
  - Removes and cancels oldest buy if total > 4
- Updated `_place_window_orders()` to initialize lists properly
- Fixed `handle_order_fill()` to update lists on fills:
  - Stop fills: Remove from trailing_stop, add to trailing_buy
  - Buy fills: Remove from trailing_buy, add to trailing_stop

### 3. **Removed Deprecated Code**
- Removed `get_window_orders()` from position_map.py
- Removed `update_sliding_window()` (deprecated function)
- Removed `handle_order_replacement()` (deprecated function)
- Removed `window_type` and `window_index` from PositionConfig
- Updated imports in __init__.py and main.py

## How It Works Now

### Initial State
```python
trailing_stop = [-4, -3, -2, -1]  # 4 stop-loss orders
trailing_buy = []                  # No buy orders
current_unit = 0
```

### Price Moves UP (e.g., unit 0 → 1)
1. Add stop-loss at unit 0 (current-1)
2. Cancel order at unit -4 (current-5)
3. Result: `trailing_stop = [-3, -2, -1, 0]`

### Price Moves DOWN (e.g., unit 1 → 0)
1. Stop at unit 0 triggers (removed from list)
2. Add buy order at unit 1 (current+1)
3. Result: `trailing_stop = [-3, -2, -1]`, `trailing_buy = [1]`

### Continuing DOWN (to unit -3)
- All stops trigger and convert to buys
- Result: `trailing_stop = []`, `trailing_buy = [-2, -1, 0, 1]`

### Further DOWN (to unit -4)
1. Add buy at unit -3
2. Cancel buy at unit 1 (maintain 4 orders)
3. Result: `trailing_buy = [-3, -2, -1, 0]`

## Testing Confirmed

The implementation was tested successfully with ETH bot:
- Initial 4 stop-losses placed correctly at units [-4, -3, -2, -1]
- Lists properly initialized: `trailing_stop = [-4, -3, -2, -1]`, `trailing_buy = []`
- Bot running stable with proper order tracking

## Benefits

1. **Correct Trailing Behavior**: All 4 orders now trail properly, not just current-1
2. **Clear Data Structure**: Lists explicitly track what's active
3. **Simpler Logic**: List operations are more intuitive than window composition checks
4. **Maintains 4 Orders**: Always keeps exactly 4 orders between both lists
5. **No Duplicate Orders**: List membership prevents duplicates

## Future Improvements

1. Could add validation to ensure total orders never exceed 4
2. Could add metrics tracking for sliding performance
3. Could optimize cancellation timing for faster slides

The sliding window now behaves exactly as specified in your requirements.
