# Sliding Window Renaming Summary

## Changes Made

Successfully renamed the vague window names to clearer, more descriptive names throughout the codebase.

### Old Names → New Names
- `window.sell_orders` → `trailing_stop`
- `window.buy_orders` → `trailing_buy`
- `SlidingWindow` class → Removed (no longer needed)

### Key Updates

1. **UnitTracker** (`strategy/unit_tracker.py`)
   - Removed the `SlidingWindow` class entirely
   - Now uses `trailing_stop` and `trailing_buy` lists directly
   - Removed dependency on old `window` object
   - Updated all phase detection to use the lists directly

2. **Main Trading Logic** (`main.py`)
   - Already using `trailing_stop` and `trailing_buy` throughout
   - Window sliding functions use the new names
   - Order fill handlers use the new names

3. **Window State API**
   - `get_window_state()` now returns both new and old names for compatibility:
     - `trailing_stop`: The list of units with stop-loss orders
     - `trailing_buy`: The list of units with limit buy orders
     - `sell_orders`: Copy of trailing_stop (backward compatibility)
     - `buy_orders`: Copy of trailing_buy (backward compatibility)

4. **Imports** (`strategy/__init__.py`)
   - Removed `SlidingWindow` from exports
   - Only exports `UnitTracker` now

### Benefits

1. **Clarity**: `trailing_stop` and `trailing_buy` immediately convey their purpose
2. **Consistency**: Names match the documentation and mental model
3. **Simplicity**: Direct list usage without wrapper class overhead
4. **Maintainability**: Easier to understand and modify

### Testing

All unit tests pass with the new naming:
- Initial state correctly uses `trailing_stop = [-4, -3, -2, -1]`
- Window sliding properly updates the lists
- Order execution correctly manages both lists

The renaming is complete and the code is now much clearer!
