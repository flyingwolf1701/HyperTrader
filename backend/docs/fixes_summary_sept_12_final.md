# Complete Fix Summary - September 12, 2025

## Issues Fixed

### 1. WebSocket Price Callback (CRITICAL FIX)
**Problem:** Price callback only triggered on unit changes, preventing proper sliding window actions
**Fix:** Now calls price callback on EVERY price update
**File:** `websocket_client.py` line 339

### 2. Sliding Window - Rapid Price Movements
**Problem:** Only placed 1 buy order when all stops triggered during rapid drops
**Fix:** Complete rewrite of sliding logic to maintain 4 trailing orders always
**Files:** `main.py` - `_slide_window_up()` and `_slide_window_down()`

### 3. Leverage Setting
**Problem:** 20x leverage failing with "Invalid leverage value"
**Fix:** Added fallback to 10x with better error messages
**File:** `hyperliquid_sdk.py` line 267

### 4. Initial Order Fill Filtering
**Problem:** Initial position order appearing as unmatched in logs
**Fix:** Track and filter initial_order_id from fill matching
**File:** `main.py` line 157, 623

### 5. Enhanced Logging
**Added:**
- Order ID tracking when placing/cancelling orders
- Position map state after sliding
- Trailing stop/buy lists on changes
- Warning-level logs for critical events

## Key Changes

### Sliding Window Down (Price Drops)
```python
# NEW BEHAVIOR:
# When price drops to unit -6:
# 1. Remove ALL stops >= -6 (they triggered)
# 2. Place 4 buys at [-5, -4, -3, -2]
# 3. Cancel buys > current_unit + 4
```

### Sliding Window Up (Price Rises)  
```python
# NEW BEHAVIOR:
# When price rises to unit 2:
# 1. Remove ALL buys <= 2 (they executed)
# 2. Place 4 stops at [1, 0, -1, -2]
# 3. Cancel stops < current_unit - 4
```

## What You'll See in Logs

### Successful Operation:
```
📋 INITIAL WINDOW STATE:
   trailing_stop: [-4, -3, -2, -1]
   trailing_buy: []
📝 ORDER ID TRACKING: Stop-loss at unit -4 = 39046043128
✅ INITIAL SETUP COMPLETE - Placed 4 stop-loss orders

[On unit change up:]
Sliding window UP to unit 1
✅ Added trailing stop at unit 0
🚫 CANCELLING stop_loss at unit -4
✅ CANCELLED stop_loss at unit -4
📊 AFTER SLIDE: Stops=[-3, -2, -1, 0], Buys=[]

[On rapid drop:]
Sliding window DOWN to unit -6
Stops triggered at units: [-4, -3, -2, -1]
Desired trailing buy units: [-5, -4, -3, -2]
✅ Added trailing buy at unit -5
✅ Added trailing buy at unit -4
✅ Added trailing buy at unit -3
✅ Added trailing buy at unit -2
📊 AFTER SLIDE: Stops=[], Buys=[-5, -4, -3, -2]
```

## Order Management
- **Orders are placed via REST API** (not WebSocket)
- **Fills arrive via WebSocket** and are matched by order ID
- **Position map** tracks orders by unit number (key) with order details
- **Order IDs** are logged for debugging fill matching

## Testing Notes

The bot should now:
1. ✅ Handle leverage fallback gracefully
2. ✅ Filter initial position orders from fill warnings  
3. ✅ Place 4 trailing buys when all stops trigger
4. ✅ Cancel old orders when sliding window
5. ✅ Log comprehensive state changes

## Remaining Considerations

If you still see issues with the first trailing stop not being cancelled, check:
1. The order might still be pending cancellation 
2. Hyperliquid API might have rate limits
3. The SDK cancel_order method signature (symbol, order_id)

The enhanced logging will now clearly show:
- When orders are placed (with IDs)
- When orders are cancelled (with IDs)
- The state of trailing_stop and trailing_buy lists
- Active orders in position_map after each slide
