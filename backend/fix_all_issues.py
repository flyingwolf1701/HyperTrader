Script to fix all the issues identified:
1. Remove position_fragment_usd references (use dict instead)
2. Remove individual short position tracking
3. Add time-based debouncing to prevent rapid trades
4. Remove ETH hardcoding
5. Use UnitTracker's dict for peak prices
6. Better unit value validation

The logs show shorts being 'opened' but they don't appear on exchange.
This suggests the short orders are failing silently or being rejected.

Possible causes:
1. Testnet doesn't allow shorts on ETH
2. Margin requirements not met
3. Order parameters incorrect
4. Need to close long before opening short at same level

Need to check:
- Exchange response when opening shorts
- Actual position state after short order
- Error handling in exchange client
