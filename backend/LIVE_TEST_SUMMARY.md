# Live Test Summary - v6.0.0 Strategy

## Current Status (As of 1:25 AM)

### ‚úÖ What's Running:
1. **Backend Server**: Running on http://localhost:8000
2. **Strategy Active**: PURR/USDC:USDC 
3. **WebSocket Monitoring**: Connected to HyperLiquid testnet
4. **Position Opened**: ~$100 long position on PURR

### üìä Current Strategy State:
- **Symbol**: PURR/USDC:USDC
- **Entry Price**: $5.1431
- **Current Price**: $5.1947 (~10 units up)
- **Phase**: ADVANCE
- **Position**: $100 long (10x leverage)
- **Unit Size**: $0.005 (very sensitive for testing)

### üîç Issue Identified:
The peak_unit is not updating properly when price rises. Current unit shows 10 but peak_unit remains 0. This needs investigation - likely an issue in the ADVANCE phase logic not properly updating peak_unit.

## Commands to Check Status:

### View Strategy Status:
```bash
curl "http://localhost:8000/api/v1/strategy/status" | python -m json.tool
```

### Check Exchange Position:
```bash
curl "http://localhost:8000/api/v1/positions" | python -m json.tool
```

### Trigger Manual Update:
```bash
curl -X POST "http://localhost:8000/api/v1/strategy/update" | python -m json.tool
```

### Monitor Strategy (Real-time):
```bash
cd backend
uv run python monitor_strategy.py
```

## What Will Happen Next:

1. **If price continues up**: 
   - Should update peak_unit to match current_unit
   - Should calculate position_fragment (10% of position value)
   
2. **If price drops**:
   - Should transition to RETRACEMENT phase
   - Will execute first trade at -1 unit from peak
   - Will sell 1 fragment and short 1 fragment

3. **WebSocket Monitoring**:
   - Running in background
   - Will detect unit changes automatically
   - Logs appear in server console

## To Stop Everything:

```bash
# Stop WebSocket monitoring
curl -X POST "http://localhost:8000/api/v1/strategy/stop-monitoring"

# Stop strategy (closes position)
curl -X POST "http://localhost:8000/api/v1/strategy/stop"

# Stop server
# Press Ctrl+C in the terminal running uvicorn
```

## Next Steps for Tomorrow:

1. **Fix peak_unit tracking** - Debug why peak isn't updating in ADVANCE phase
2. **Test phase transitions** - Force price movements to test all 4 phases
3. **Verify WebSocket** - Check if real-time price updates are working
4. **Test position_fragment** - Ensure it's calculated correctly at peak
5. **Run full cycle** - Test complete ADVANCE ‚Üí RETRACEMENT ‚Üí DECLINE ‚Üí RECOVERY ‚Üí RESET

## Your Position is Safe:
- Only $100 at risk (testnet funds)
- 10x leverage means $10 margin used
- Stop strategy anytime with the stop command above

Sleep well! The system is monitoring and will track any price movements. You can check the logs and status in the morning.
