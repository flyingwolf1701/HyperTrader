# HyperTrader Grid Strategy Analysis Report

## Executive Summary
After 15 minutes of observation, the HyperTrader grid trading bot exhibits **critical failures** in its core functionality. Despite receiving continuous price data showing SOL crossing multiple unit boundaries (from $207.85 to $209.07), **the strategy failed to detect ANY unit changes** and consequently never adjusted its grid orders.

## Key Findings

### 1. CRITICAL BUG: Unit Tracker Fails to Emit Events
**Expected:** When price moves from $207.85 to $209.07, crossing units -1, 0, 1, and 2 (with $0.50 unit size)
**Actual:** Zero unit change events emitted despite price crossing multiple boundaries

**Evidence from Raw Data:**
- Starting price: $207.85 (unit -1)
- Price reached: $209.07 (unit 2)
- Expected unit changes: 4 crossings (-1â†’0, 0â†’1, 1â†’2, plus reverse)
- Actual unit changes detected: **0**

### 2. Grid Orders Never Adjusted
**Expected:** As price moves up, place new sell orders and cancel oldest ones (FIFO)
**Actual:** Initial 4 sell orders remained unchanged throughout entire session

**Initial Grid (Correctly Placed):**
- Unit -1: Sell 0.12 SOL @ $207.57
- Unit -2: Sell 0.12 SOL @ $207.07
- Unit -3: Sell 0.12 SOL @ $206.57
- Unit -4: Sell 0.12 SOL @ $206.07

**After 15 minutes (Should Have Changed):** Identical, no adjustments made

### 3. WebSocket Price Updates Working But Ignored
The raw trade data clearly shows active price movement:
```
RAW SYNC TRADE DATA (SOL): {'coin': 'SOL', 'px': '209.07', 'sz': '34.81'...}
RAW SYNC TRADE DATA (SOL): {'coin': 'SOL', 'px': '209.06', 'sz': '0.09'...}
RAW SYNC TRADE DATA (SOL): {'coin': 'SOL', 'px': '209.02', 'sz': '51.72'...}
```

Yet the strategy never processes these price changes for unit boundary detection.

### 4. Missing Critical Logs
**Expected logs when price crosses units:**
```
ðŸ”„ UNIT CHANGE: 0 â†’ 1 (price: $208.57)
ðŸ“ˆ PROCESS_UNIT_UP: Moving from unit 0 to 1
```

**Actual:** No unit change logs whatsoever

## Root Cause Analysis

The issue appears to be in the connection between:
1. **WebSocket price callback** â†’ **UnitTracker.update_price()** â†’ **Strategy.handle_unit_change()**

Specifically, in `hyperliquid_sdk_websocket.py:_handle_trades_sync()`:
```python
if self.is_connected and symbol in self.price_callbacks and self.price_callbacks[symbol]:
    try:
        self.price_callbacks[symbol](price)  # This should trigger unit tracker update
    except Exception as e:
        if "no running event loop" not in str(e).lower():
            logger.error(f"Error calling price callback: {e}")
```

The price callback is being called (no errors logged), but the unit tracker is not receiving or processing these updates.

## Failed Expectations vs Reality

| Expected Behavior | Actual Behavior | Impact |
|------------------|-----------------|---------|
| Unit changes detected every $0.50 move | Zero unit changes detected | Grid never adjusts |
| Trailing stop orders follow price up | Orders remain static | No profit taking on upward moves |
| Place-then-cancel order management | No order management occurred | Grid becomes stale |
| LIFO for filled orders | No orders filled to test | Cannot verify fill handling |
| Trailing buys activate on downward moves | Never tested due to no unit changes | Cannot verify buy-side logic |

## Critical Issues Requiring Immediate Fix

1. **Unit Tracker Integration:** The price feed is not properly connected to the unit tracker's `update_price()` method
2. **Event Emission:** Even if prices are updated, the unit change events are not being emitted or handled
3. **Callback Registration:** The strategy's `handle_unit_change` method may not be properly registered with the unit tracker

## Recommendation

The application has a fundamental disconnect between its price feed and strategy logic. Despite receiving accurate real-time prices from Hyperliquid, the strategy never processes them for grid adjustments. This makes the bot essentially non-functional beyond initial order placement.

**Immediate action required:** Debug the price callback chain from WebSocket â†’ UnitTracker â†’ Strategy to identify where the connection is broken.
