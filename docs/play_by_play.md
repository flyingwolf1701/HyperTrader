# **Hedging Strategy - Play-by-Play Examples (Updated)**

## **Complete Phase Structure Overview**

* **Phase 1**: Bull Run to Peak (both allocations 100% long)
* **Phase 2**: Retracement Begins (confirmation required, hedge starts scaling)
* **Phase 2.5**: Partial Cash Zone Choppy Trading (tight trading when partially cashed out)
* **Phase 3**: Continued Decline (long allocation fully cashed, shorts compound)
* **Phase 4**: Valley Formation and Recovery Confirmation (valley reset, recovery begins)
* **Phase 4.5**: Recovery Zone Choppy Trading (tight trading when partially recovered)

---

## **Example 1: Classic Bull Run with 30% Pullback**

### **Initial Setup**

* **Purchase Price**: $100 per unit  
* **Total Allocation**: $200 (50% long allocation + 50% hedge allocation)  
* **Leverage**: 2x  
* **Unit Value**: $5 (5% of $100 margin invested)

### **Phase 1: Bull Run to Peak**

| Price | Gain | Units from Entry | Long Allocation | Hedge Allocation | Total Portfolio |
|-------|------|------------------|-----------------|------------------|-----------------|
| $100 | 0% | 0 | **100% Long ($100)** | **100% Long ($100)** | **$200 total** |
| $110 | 10% | +2 | 100% Long ($110) | 100% Long ($110) | $220 total |
| $125 | 25% | +5 | 100% Long ($125) | 100% Long ($125) | $250 total |
| $130 | 30% | +6 | 100% Long ($130) | 100% Long ($130) | **$260 total** |

**System Status**: PEAK established at $130, both allocations worth $130 each

### **Phase 2: Retracement Begins (Confirmation Required)**

| Price | Drop from Peak | Units Down | Long Allocation | Hedge Long | Hedge Short | Action |
|-------|----------------|------------|-----------------|------------|-------------|--------|
| $125 | -3.8% | -1.0 | 100% Long ($125) | 75% ($97.50) | 25% ($32.50) | **WAIT**: Need 2 units confirmation, hedge starts scaling |
| $118.5 | -8.8% | -2.0 | **75% Long ($88.88)** | 50% ($59.25) | 50% ($59.25) | **CONFIRMED**: Exit 25% long, hedge continues scaling |
| $113 | -13.1% | -3.0 | **50% Long ($56.50)** | 25% ($28.25) | 75% ($84.75) | Exit another 25% long, hedge majority short |
| $107 | -17.7% | -4.0 | **25% Long ($26.75)** | 0% | 100% ($113) | Exit another 25% long, hedge fully short |
| $102 | -21.5% | -5.0 | **0% Long (Cash: $100)** | 0% | 100% ($127) | Exit final 25% long |

**Critical Logic:**
* **2-unit confirmation** required before long allocation starts exiting  
* **25% incremental exits** for each additional unit down  
* **Hedge provides protection** during the 2-unit wait period

### **Phase 2.5: Partial Cash Zone Choppy Trading**

**CRITICAL PHASE**: When long allocation is partially cashed out (-2 to -5 units), the system enters choppy market protection mode.

**Starting Setup**: Peak at $145 (+9 units), now retracing through the partial cash zone

| Price Movement | Units | Long Status | Cash Value | Long Value | Total | Hedge Total | Portfolio | Action |
|----------------|-------|-------------|------------|------------|-------|-------------|-----------|--------|
| **Peak Reference** | +9.0 | 100% Long | $0.00 | $145.00 | $145.00 | $145.00 | $290.00 | Peak established |
| Drop to $140 | +8.0 | 100% Long | $0.00 | $140.00 | $140.00 | $140.00 | $280.00 | Wait (need 2-unit confirmation) |
| Drop to $135 | +7.0 | 75% Long | $35.00 | $101.25 | $136.25 | $135.00 | $271.25 | **CONFIRMED**: Exit 25% |
| **CHOPPY OSCILLATION BEGINS** | | | | | | | | |
| Recover to $140 | +8.0 | 100% Long | $0.00 | $140.00 | $140.00 | $140.00 | $280.00 | **Buy back 25%** |
| Drop to $135 | +7.0 | 75% Long | $35.00 | $101.25 | $136.25 | $135.00 | $271.25 | **Sell 25%** (Round Trip 1: -$4.25 loss) |
| Small recover to $137.5 | +7.5 | 75% Long | $35.00 | $103.13 | $138.13 | $137.50 | $275.63 | Hold (only 0.5 unit) |
| Drop to $130 | +6.0 | 50% Long | $67.50 | $65.00 | $132.50 | $130.00 | $262.50 | **Sell 25%** |
| Recover to $135 | +7.0 | 75% Long | $33.75 | $101.25 | $135.00 | $135.00 | $270.00 | **Buy back 25%** |
| Drop to $125 | +5.0 | 25% Long | $96.88 | $31.25 | $128.13 | $125.00 | $253.13 | **Sell 25%** (Round Trip 2: -$5.00 loss) |

**Phase 2.5 Trading Rules:**
* **1-unit movements trigger 25% position changes** (no confirmation delays)
* **Fast response when positions need protection**
* **0.5 unit moves ignored** to reduce overtrading
* **Accept small controlled losses to prevent major drawdowns**

**Phase 2.5 Analysis:**
* **Total Cost**: ~$12.88 in trading losses + fees
* **Portfolio Protection**: Prevented potential $30+ loss from holding 100% long
* **Net Benefit**: +$17.12 damage control vs. unprotected holding

### **Phase 3: Continued Decline**

| Price | Drop from Peak | Units Down | Long Allocation | Hedge Short Value | Total Portfolio |
|-------|----------------|------------|-----------------|-------------------|-----------------|
| $100 | -23.1% | -6.0 | Cash ($100) | $130 × (130/100) = $169 | $269 |
| $95 | -26.9% | -7.0 | Cash ($100) | $130 × (130/95) = $178 | $278 |
| $91 | -30% | -7.8 | Cash ($100) | $130 × (130/91) = $186 | $286 |
| $85 | -34.6% | -9.0 | Cash ($100) | $130 × (130/85) = $199 | $299 |

**Key Insight**: Even as price crashes, portfolio value increases due to profitable shorts

### **Phase 4: Valley Formation and Recovery Confirmation**

| Price | Valley Status | Units from Valley | Long Allocation | Hedge Long | Hedge Short | Action |
|-------|---------------|-------------------|-----------------|------------|-------------|--------|
| $85 | **NEW VALLEY** | 0 | Cash ($100) | 0% | 100% ($155) | Valley established - reset reference |
| $90 | Recovery | +1.0 | Cash ($100) | 25% ($38.75) | 75% ($116.25) | **LONG WAITS** / **HEDGE TRADES** |
| $95 | Recovery | +2.0 | **25% Long ($23.75)** | 50% ($77.50) | 50% ($77.50) | **CONFIRMED**: Long starts / Hedge continues |
| $100 | Recovery | +3.0 | **50% Long ($50)** | 75% ($116.25) | 25% ($38.75) | Both allocations trading |
| $105 | Recovery | +4.0 | **75% Long ($78.75)** | 100% ($155) | 0% | Both continue scaling |
| $110 | Recovery | +5.0 | **100% Long ($110)** | 100% ($163) | 0% | Both fully long |

**Recovery Logic:**
* **Long allocation**: Patient - waits 2 units, then 25% increments  
* **Hedge allocation**: Aggressive - trades every unit immediately  
* **Valley resets**: Each new low becomes the reference point for recovery

### **Phase 4.5: Recovery Zone Choppy Trading**

**NEW PHASE**: When long allocation is partially recovered (+2 to +5 units from valley), choppy trading can occur during recovery.

**Starting Setup**: Valley at $85, now recovering but hitting choppy conditions around $95-$105 range

| Price Movement | Units | Long Status | Cash Value | Long Value | Total | Hedge Total | Portfolio | Action |
|----------------|-------|-------------|------------|------------|-------|-------------|-----------|--------|
| **Valley Reference** | 0.0 | 0% Long | $100.00 | $0.00 | $100.00 | $155.00 | $255.00 | Valley established |
| Recovery to $95 | +2.0 | 25% Long | $75.00 | $23.75 | $98.75 | $77.50 | $176.25 | **CONFIRMED**: Long starts |
| **CHOPPY RECOVERY BEGINS** | | | | | | | | |
| Drop to $90 | +1.0 | 0% Long | $98.75 | $0.00 | $98.75 | $116.25 | $215.00 | **Sell 25%** |
| Recover to $95 | +2.0 | 25% Long | $75.00 | $23.75 | $98.75 | $77.50 | $176.25 | **Buy back 25%** (Round Trip 1: -$1.25 loss) |
| Drop to $90 | +1.0 | 0% Long | $98.75 | $0.00 | $98.75 | $116.25 | $215.00 | **Sell 25%** |
| Recover to $100 | +3.0 | 50% Long | $50.00 | $50.00 | $100.00 | $38.75 | $138.75 | **Buy back 25% + 25% more** |
| Drop to $95 | +2.0 | 25% Long | $75.00 | $23.75 | $98.75 | $77.50 | $176.25 | **Sell 25%** (Round Trip 2: -$2.50 loss) |

**Phase 4.5 Trading Rules:**
* **Same as Phase 2.5**: 1-unit movements trigger 25% position changes
* **No confirmation delays** when positions need protection during recovery
* **0.5 unit moves ignored** to reduce overtrading
* **Starting point**: No long allocation (vs Phase 2.5 which starts with full long allocation)

**Phase 4.5 vs Phase 2.5 Comparison:**

| Aspect | Phase 2.5 (Decline Chop) | Phase 4.5 (Recovery Chop) |
|--------|---------------------------|----------------------------|
| **Starting Position** | 100% Long Allocation | 0% Long Allocation |
| **Direction Bias** | Protecting gains during decline | Building position during recovery |
| **Trading Rules** | 1-unit triggers, no confirmation | 1-unit triggers, no confirmation |
| **Reference Point** | Peak price | Valley price |
| **Risk Management** | Prevent major drawdowns | Avoid missing recovery while managing chop |
| **Fee Tolerance** | Accept costs to protect capital | Accept costs to capture recovery |

**Key Insight**: Both .5 phases handle choppy markets with the same tight trading rules, but Phase 4.5 starts from a defensive cash position and builds up, while Phase 2.5 starts from a fully invested position and scales down.

## **Example 2: Leveraged Position (10x Leverage)**

### **Modified Calculations**

* **Margin Invested**: $100
* **Base Unit**: $5 (5% of $100 margin)
* **Leveraged Position Size**: $1,000 total exposure
* **Unit Triggers**: Based on margin gains/losses, not position size

### **Leveraged Trigger Example**

| Price Move | Margin P&L | Units Gained/Lost | Action |
|------------|------------|-------------------|--------|
| +1% price | +$10 margin gain | +2.0 units | Continue holding |
| -2.5% price | -$25 margin loss | -5.0 units | Trigger full hedge |
| -5% price | -$50 margin loss | -10.0 units | Multiple cascade triggers |

**Key Insight**: With 10x leverage, a 2.5% price drop creates a -$25 margin loss = -5 units, triggering full hedge deployment

## **Phase Summary & Conditions**

### **Phase Transition Conditions**

| Phase | Entry Condition | Exit Condition | Allocation State |
|-------|----------------|----------------|------------------|
| **Phase 1** | Initial entry | Peak established | Both 100% long |
| **Phase 2** | -1 unit from peak | -5 units OR recovery to peak | Long scaling down, hedge scaling to short |
| **Phase 2.5** | Long allocation 25-75% (choppy decline) | Long allocation 0% OR smooth decline/recovery | Tight trading rules active |
| **Phase 3** | Long allocation 0% (cash) | Valley formation | Cash + profitable shorts |
| **Phase 4** | New valley established | +5 units from valley | Long scaling up, hedge scaling from short |
| **Phase 4.5** | Long allocation 25-75% (choppy recovery) | Long allocation 100% OR smooth recovery | Tight trading rules active |

### **Choppy Market Detection**

**Phase 2.5 Triggers**: Price oscillates while long allocation is partially cashed out (-2 to -5 units)
**Phase 4.5 Triggers**: Price oscillates while long allocation is partially recovered (+2 to +5 units from valley)

**Both phases use identical tight trading rules:**
* 1-unit movements = 25% position changes
* No confirmation delays
* 0.5 unit movements ignored
* Accept small fees to manage chop effectively
