# HyperTrader 15-Minute Observation Report

## Executive Summary
**CRITICAL FAILURE**: The bot is NOT working as expected. While unit detection is now functional after the math.floor() fix, the grid management logic has a severe bug causing duplicate order placement. The bot is placing multiple orders at the same price levels instead of maintaining exactly 4 trailing stops as designed.

## Test Configuration
- **Symbol:** ETH
- **Unit Size:** $10.00 (reduced from $25 for more frequent triggers)
- **Position Value:** $100
- **Leverage:** 25x
- **Network:** Testnet
- **Observation Period:** ~5 minutes before critical issue identified

## Critical Issue: Duplicate Order Placement

### Problem Observed
From the exchange order history:
- Multiple stop orders placed at identical price levels (e.g., 4160, 4150)
- Orders being placed seconds apart at the same units
- Far more than 4 trailing stop orders active
- Pattern suggests the bot is not tracking its existing orders properly

### Root Cause Analysis
The grid strategy has a logic flaw in `_process_unit_up` and `_process_unit_down`:

1. **Missing Duplicate Check**: Before placing a new order at a unit, the code checks if the unit is in the `trailing_stop` or `trailing_buy` list, but does NOT verify if an order is already active on the exchange at that unit.

2. **Race Condition**: When processing unit changes rapidly, the bot may:
   - Assume an order filled (remove from list)
   - Place a replacement order
   - But if the original order wasn't actually filled, we now have duplicates

3. **Code Issue** (lines 263-265 and 300-303):
```python
# Check if unit is in list, but NOT if order already exists
if new_sell_unit not in self.trailing_stop:
    await self._place_sell_order_at_unit(new_sell_unit)
    self.trailing_buy.append(new_sell_unit)
```

## Pattern Verification Results

### ❌ Expected Pattern NOT Observed
**Expected:**
- Exactly 4 trailing stops at any time
- LIFO for fills (last in list)
- FIFO for cancels (first in list)
- Place-then-cancel sequencing

**Actual:**
- Multiple duplicate orders at same price levels
- More than 4 stop orders active
- Order placement without proper existing order verification
- List management appears correct in logs but doesn't match exchange state

### Unit Detection ✅ Working
The math.floor() fix successfully resolved unit detection:
- Unit changes are properly detected
- Events are correctly emitted
- Price movements trigger appropriate callbacks

## List Management Analysis

### Initial Setup ✅
```
trailing_stop = [-4, -3, -2, -1]  # Correct ordering
trailing_buy = []
```

### First Unit Change (0 → -1) ⚠️
- Correctly detected unit change
- Assumed sell fill at unit -1
- Removed -1 from trailing_stop (LIFO ✅)
- Placed buy at unit 0
- **BUT**: If the sell at -1 hadn't actually filled, we now have an orphaned order

## Recommendations

### Immediate Fix Required
1. **Add Order Existence Check**: Before placing any order, verify with exchange/position_map if an order already exists at that unit
2. **Implement Fill Confirmation**: Don't assume fills - wait for actual WebSocket confirmation before updating state
3. **Add State Reconciliation**: Periodically sync local state with exchange state

### Code Fix Needed
```python
# Before placing order, check if one already exists
active_orders = self.position_map.get_active_orders_at_unit(new_sell_unit)
if not active_orders and new_sell_unit not in self.trailing_stop:
    await self._place_sell_order_at_unit(new_sell_unit)
    self.trailing_stop.append(new_sell_unit)
```

## Conclusion

The bot has a **CRITICAL BUG** in order management. While unit tracking now works correctly, the grid strategy is placing duplicate orders because it:

1. Assumes order fills without confirmation
2. Doesn't check for existing orders before placing new ones
3. Has a race condition between assumed fills and actual exchange state

**Status: FAILED** - The bot is NOT safe for production use. It will spam the exchange with duplicate orders and potentially lose funds due to improper position management.

## Test Terminated
Test was stopped after ~5 minutes upon discovering the critical duplicate order issue. The bot requires immediate fixes to the order management logic before further testing.
