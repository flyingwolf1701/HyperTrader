# Advanced Hedging Strategy v4.0 - Complete Implementation Guide

## **Core Philosophy**

This is a **bull market thesis strategy** designed to profit in both directions while maintaining long-term upward bias. The system uses automated execution to capture gains during retracements and amplify returns during recoveries, remaining profitable even during significant drawdowns.

The strategy features a **critical peak/valley reset mechanism** that scales with portfolio growth and uses **WebSocket-driven price monitoring** with **CCXT exchange integration** for real-time execution.

## **Portfolio Architecture**

### **Two Independent Allocation System**

**Long Allocation**: Patient capital that waits for optimal entries
- Requires 2-unit confirmation before scaling positions
- Focuses on longer-term trend reversals
- Starts at 50% of total margin but diverges based on performance

**Hedge Allocation**: Active protection capital that responds immediately  
- Immediate 1-unit response to price movements
- Provides downside protection and profit from corrections
- Starts at 50% of total margin but diverges based on performance

### **Unit-Based Tracking System**

**Unit Definition**: 1 unit = the price movement required to generate a 5% profit on original margin
- With 10x leverage: 0.5% price move = 5% margin profit = 1 unit
- With 20x leverage: 0.25% price move = 5% margin profit = 1 unit  
- Example: $100 entry at 10x leverage → 1 unit = $0.50 price movement ($100 × 0.5%)
- Only whole units trigger actions (no 0.5, 1.5, 2.5 unit movements)
- `currentUnit` tracks current position relative to entry price
- Units scale with portfolio growth through reset mechanism

**Key Variables**:
- `entryPrice`: Current average price paid per coin (from Hyperliquid, updated when peakUnit resets)
- `currentUnit`: Current price distance from reference point
- `peakUnit`: Highest unit reached (null when longInvested = 0)  
- `valleyUnit`: Lowest unit reached (null when hedgeShort = 0)
- `longInvested`: Dollar amount in long positions
- `longCash`: Dollar amount held as cash
- `hedgeLong`: Dollar amount in hedge long positions  
- `hedgeShort`: Dollar amount in hedge short positions

## **Critical Peak/Valley Reset Mechanism**

### **Peak Tracking Rules**
- **peakUnit = null** when `longInvested = 0` (no long positions to track peaks from)
- **peakUnit = currentUnit** when `longInvested > 0` (establish new peak reference)
- **`entryPrice` updated** when peakUnit resets (new average price from Hyperliquid)
- Peak tracking becomes active only when there are long positions to protect

### **Valley Tracking Rules**
- **valleyUnit = null** when `hedgeShort = 0` (no short positions to track valleys from)
- **valleyUnit = currentUnit** when `hedgeShort > 0` (establish new valley reference)
- Valley tracking becomes active only when there are short positions that can benefit from recovery

### **System Reset Trigger**
**Only occurs when BOTH conditions are met:**
- `hedgeShort = $0` (no short positions)
- `longCash = $0` (no cash positions)

**Reset Process:**
1. Split total portfolio value 50/50 between allocations
2. Reset all tracking variables:
   - `currentUnit = 0`
   - `peakUnit = 0` 
   - `valleyUnit = null`
3. Establish new reference price
4. Recalculate unit size based on new portfolio value
5. Reset `entryPrice` to the current average price per coin

## **Four-Phase Trading System**

### **ADVANCE Phase**
**Characteristics**: Both allocations 100% long, tracking peaks
- Building positions during uptrends
- Establishing new peak references
- Both allocations riding the trend upward

**Trigger**: When both allocations are fully long
**Action**: Hold positions, track peak progression

### **RETRACEMENT Phase**  
**Characteristics**: Decline from peak, confirmation rules active
- Hedge scales immediately on 1-unit movements
- Long waits for 2-unit confirmation before scaling
- Choppy trading detection when partially allocated

**Trigger**: Any decline from established peak
**Actions**:
- **Hedge**: Immediate 25% scaling per unit movement
- **Long**: Waits for confirmation, then scales 25% per confirmed unit

### **DECLINE Phase**
**Characteristics**: Long fully cashed, hedge fully short
- Long allocation 100% cash (protection complete)
- Hedge allocation 100% short (profit from decline)
- Short positions compound gains during major corrections

**Trigger**: Long allocation reaches 0% invested
**Action**: Hold positions, let shorts compound gains

### **RECOVERY Phase**
**Characteristics**: Recovery from valley, systematic re-entry
- Hedge unwinds shorts immediately on 1-unit recovery movements
- Long re-enters with 2-unit confirmation 
- Valley tracking guides recovery process

**Trigger**: Any recovery from established valley
**Actions**:
- **Hedge**: Immediate unwinding of shorts, scale back to long
- **Long**: Waits for confirmation, then systematic re-entry

## **Choppy Trading Detection & Management**

### **Automatic Detection**
**Trigger**: When either allocation is partially allocated
- Long allocation: 0% < longInvested < 100%  
- Hedge allocation: 0% < hedgeLong < 100% AND hedgeShort > 0%

### **Choppy Trading Rules**
- **No confirmation delays**: 1-unit movements trigger immediate 25% position changes
- **Faster response**: Protect against rapid oscillations
- **Tighter trading**: Minimize exposure during uncertain periods
- **Fee management**: Still only responds to whole unit movements

## **Position Scaling Matrix**

### **Long Allocation Scaling (Confirmation Required)**

| Units from Peak | Long Position | Action | Trigger |
|-----------------|---------------|---------|---------|
| 0 units | 100% Long | Hold | Peak tracking |
| -1 unit | 100% Long | **WAIT** | No action (needs confirmation) |
| -2 units | 75% Long | **Sell 25%** | Confirmed decline |
| -3 units | 50% Long | **Sell 25%** | Continued decline |
| -4 units | 25% Long | **Sell 25%** | Significant decline |
| -5 units | 0% Long | **Sell 25%** | Full cash (DECLINE phase) |

### **Hedge Allocation Scaling (Immediate Response)**

| Units from Peak | Hedge Long | Hedge Short | Action | Phase |
|-----------------|------------|-------------|---------|-------|
| 0 units | 100% Long | 0% Short | Hold | ADVANCE |
| -1 unit | 75% Long | 25% Short | **Sell 25% → Short** | RETRACEMENT |
| -2 units | 50% Long | 50% Short | **Sell 25% → Short** | RETRACEMENT |
| -3 units | 25% Long | 75% Short | **Sell 25% → Short** | RETRACEMENT |
| -4 units | 0% Long | 100% Short | **Sell 25% → Short** | DECLINE |

### **Recovery Scaling (From Valley)**

| Units from Valley | Long Position | Action | Hedge Position | Action | Phase |
|-------------------|---------------|---------|----------------|---------|-------|
| +1 unit | 0% Long | **WAIT** | 25% Long / 75% Short | Cover 25% → Long | RECOVERY |
| +2 units | 25% Long | **Buy 25%** | 50% Long / 50% Short | Cover 25% → Long | RECOVERY |
| +3 units | 50% Long | **Buy 25%** | 75% Long / 25% Short | Cover 25% → Long | RECOVERY |
| +4 units | 75% Long | **Buy 25%** | 100% Long / 0% Short | Cover 25% → Long | RECOVERY |
| +5 units | 100% Long | **Buy 25%** | 100% Long / 0% Short | Hold Long | ADVANCE → **RESET TRIGGER** |
