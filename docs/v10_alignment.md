Code Analysis vs. Strategy Doc v10
This document provides a detailed analysis of the provided Python codebase against the "Long-Biased Grid Trading Strategy v10.0.0" document.

Overall Assessment
The current codebase is partially aligned with the v10 strategy document but appears to be based on an older, more complex version of the strategy. It has significant architectural differences and contains logic that has been explicitly removed from the v10 specification.

The code does not yet implement the simplified, continuous 4-order sliding window described in v10. Instead, it reflects a phase-based system with more complex state management.

SDK Integration Status
The Hyperliquid SDK integration is properly implemented and functional:
- **WebSocket Client (websocket_client.py)**: Correctly uses `hyperliquid.ws_client.WsClient` with proper authentication and callback patterns
- **REST API Client (hyperliquid_sdk.py)**: Properly uses `hyperliquid.exchange.Exchange` and `hyperliquid.info.Info` for trading operations
- **Connection Management**: SDK handles reconnection and heartbeat automatically
- **Authentication**: Private key loading and account initialization are correctly implemented

Key Areas of Misalignment

1. Core Logic: Phase-Based vs. Continuous Window
   Strategy Doc (v10): The core logic is simplified to a continuous 4-order window. The concept of distinct "phases" is minimized, and the system's state is simply the current composition of buy and sell orders.

Code (unit_tracker.py, data_models.py): The code is built around a distinct, multi-phase system (ADVANCE, RETRACEMENT, DECLINE, RECOVERY, RESET). The UnitTracker and data_models.py have explicit logic for detecting and managing these phases, which is more complex than the v10 doc requires.

# src/strategy/data_models.py - This is from an older strategy version

class Phase(Enum):
"""Trading phases based on order composition"""
ADVANCE = "advance"
RETRACEMENT = "retracement"
DECLINE = "decline"
RECOVERY = "recovery"
RESET = "reset"

2. The RESET Mechanism
   Strategy Doc (v10): Explicitly states that a hard "Reset Phase" is no longer needed. Compounding happens organically by adding realized PnL to buy fragments.

Code (data_models.py): The Phase enum includes a RESET phase, indicating that the logic is built to accommodate a full cycle reset, which contradicts the simplified compounding approach of v10.

3. Simplicity and Code Structure
   Strategy Doc (v10): Describes a very streamlined and elegant logic based on a single fundamental rule (always 4 orders) and dynamic replacement.

Code (main.py, unit_tracker.py): The implementation in main.py is far more complex than what v10 requires. It appears to be orchestrating a more complicated state machine. The UnitTracker is also more involved than a simple unit calculator needs to be for the v10 strategy. The presence of files like position_map.py suggests a more granular, per-unit level of state management than the high-level rules of v10 would imply.

4. Order Types
   Strategy Doc (v10): Specifies stop-loss sell orders and stop-entry buy orders.

Code (data_models.py): The OrderType enum is more aligned, containing STOP_LOSS_SELL and STOP_BUY. This is a point of good alignment.

# src/strategy/data_models.py - This is well-aligned

class OrderType(Enum):
"""Types of orders used in the long wallet strategy"""
STOP_LOSS_SELL = "stop_sell"
STOP_BUY = "stop_buy"
MARKET_BUY = "market_buy"
MARKET_SELL = "market_sell"

5. Missing Core Strategy Implementation
   Strategy Doc (v10): Requires initial market buy to establish full position, dynamic order replacement on fills, and continuous grid sliding.

Code (main.py): The strategy_task function (lines 41-71) is essentially empty, containing only logging statements. Critical missing implementations:
- No initial position establishment via market buy
- No order placement logic for the 4-order grid
- No dynamic order replacement when orders fill
- No grid sliding mechanism when price moves without triggering orders

# main.py - Empty strategy loop
async def strategy_task(position_map: PositionMap, unit_tracker: UnitTracker):
    while True:
        # Only contains logging, no actual trading logic
        logger.info(f"Strategy Check | Price: ${current_price:.2f}")

6. Incomplete Order Management
   Strategy Doc (v10): Emphasizes immediate order replacement - when a sell fills, place a buy at current_unit + 1; when a buy fills, place a sell at current_unit - 1.

Code: The handle_order_fill callback (main.py:28-31) only logs the fill but doesn't implement the replacement logic. The position_map.handle_order_fill method would need to be examined, but the main orchestration is missing.

7. Fragment and Position Tracking
   Strategy Doc (v10): Defines clear fragment calculations - 25% of position for each order, with sells in asset terms and buys in USD terms.

Code: While PositionState and PositionConfig structures exist in data_models.py with fragment calculations, they're not connected to actual order placement. The position tracking is present but unused.

Recommended Refactoring Path

1. **Simplify Phase System**: Remove the Phase enum entirely or reduce it to simple state indicators. The system should track only the composition of active orders (e.g., "3 sells, 1 buy").

2. **Implement Core Trading Loop**:
   - Add initial market buy logic in strategy_task
   - Implement the 4-order placement logic
   - Add order replacement on fills
   - Implement grid sliding for trending markets

3. **Streamline Data Models**: Remove complex state management in favor of simple order tracking lists as shown in unit_tracker.py (trailing_stop and trailing_buy lists).

4. **Connect Fragment Logic**: Use the existing fragment calculations to actually place orders with correct sizes.

5. **Leverage SDK Properly**: The SDK integration is solid - use it to implement the missing order placement and management logic.
